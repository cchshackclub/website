                <h1>Today we're doing: building websites!</h1>
                <p>
                    This (and the main <a href="./index.html">page</a>) was
                    written with HTML and CSS! We talked about it last week.
                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and represents
                    the content and structure of a web page. Content is created
                    using tags. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and helps
                    style a web page.
                    <b>Inspect this website to see the styles for it!</b> You
                    can also see the HTML for the main page
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/cchshackclub/website/blob/main/index.html"
                        >here</a
                    >, and the CSS for it
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/cchshackclub/website/blob/main/index.css"
                        >here</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not the best teacher, as you saw last week, so here's a
                    <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/"
                        >workshop</a
                    >
                    to go through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm building a website too on Replit! It is currently at
                    <a href="https://portfolio.jianmin-chen.repl.co"
                        >https://portfolio.jianmin-chen.repl.co</a
                    >. I'm going to be working on it during the meeting with you
                    guys during the club meeting, so if you need any help,
                    holler!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can make whatever website you want to. I don't care if
                    it's a personal website, with info about you (like I'm
                    building), or a website of memes. Just go wild! Also, a tip
                    now:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    If you need help finding a HTML tag or learning how to style
                    something, just <b>Google</b> it!
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    And if you want inspiration, here are also some cool
                    websites made by other Hack Clubbers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://jianminchen.com">My website</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://kognise.dev/">Kognise</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://celeste.exposed/">Celeste</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://sarthakmohanty.me/">Sarthak</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://tmb.sh/">Theo</a></li>

                        <a href="https://www.matthewstanciu.me/">Matthew</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of them have their own unique styles!</p>
                <p>
                    If you have no idea what kind of website you want to create,
                    you can try copying this one. If you have no idea what kind
                    of design you want to do, just think about it! Or lay out
                    the HTML first.

                    If you want to code on your own time, there are a lot of
                    Hack Club workshops! And of course, Google based on your
                    interests.

                    If you want to bring your own computer in, feel free to do
                    so! There shouldn't be any issues, as long as you don't go
                    against common sense and do something you're not supposed to
                    do in school.
