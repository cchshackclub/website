            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p>
                We're a group of coders at Chicopee Comprehensive High School
                interested in building with technology, whether that be
                software(<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"
                    >programming</a
                >) or hardware (3D printing, building computers). In other
                words, we do a lot of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture"
                    >hacking</a
                >. We also happen to be a chapter of the international
                non-profit <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Who can join?</h2>
            <p>
                Anybody can! No matter what your experience, you can come around
                at the above specified time and just hang around and have fun!
                We make sure that everybody new to hacking gets a fun
                introduction to it.
            </p>
            <h2>What exactly do we do during a meeting?</h2>
            <p>
                During a meeting, people will collab or work on their own to
                build something or make progress towards building something
                cool. Towards the end of the meeting, everyone will demo and
                show off their creations! It's intended to be super chill.
            </p>
